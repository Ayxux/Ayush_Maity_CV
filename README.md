# Ayush Maity- CV repository ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to my CV repository! 

I'm Ayush Maity, a 3rd-year Computer Science and Engineering undergrad of a 4 year course passionate about exploring and innovating in the realm of computer systems. My academic and project journey has been deeply rooted in computer architecture, operating systems, semiconductors, high performance computing, computer networks and also cloud computing. Sometimes it can also range to casual interest in learning about philosophy, economics, a lot of films and music.

From developing a communication module to prototyping it on an fpga to a 5-stage RISC-V pipeline simulator to hands-on research at DRDO, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in understanding the intricate details of systems and i'm still a humble beginner trying to learn more everyday. Iâ€™m particularly fascinated by niche areas like cache memory optimizations, low-latency architectures, and at times the strangeness of quantum computing.

My long-term vision includes pursuing higher studies and contributing to groundbreaking advancements in computer architecture and hardware systems.

Feel free to explore my CV to learn more about my experiences and aspirations. I'm always open to connecting, collaborating, or discussing exciting opportunities in technology!
